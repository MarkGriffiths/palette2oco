#### Open Color's ColorValue object - Extended

Enables a much wider range of color spaces, conversion, and esoteric customisation in the server, build tool or preprocessor. Supports:

- Handling a wider range or color notations, such as those found in JSON and native Objects and Arrays.
- Uses my port of Tinycolor, es-tinycolor for tighter control of minimisation and tree-shaking.
- Add supports for L*ab, CMYK, RGBA Bytes
- Generate aesthetic palettes, or describe dynamic scaling along curves from oco files with Chroma support.
